# Integrating Region Proposal Network and Segment Model for Enhanced Out-of-Distribution Object Detection

This repository contains the implementation of an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection model that combines the strengths of [Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/segment-anything/) and [Faster R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497).
